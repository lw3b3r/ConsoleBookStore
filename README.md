## Getting Started

To Clone:
`git clone https://github.com/201019-UiPath/WeberLindsey-Project1.git`

- Once cloned, you will need to create an appsettings.json file to direct the application to your database
- Database tables can be created using EF Core Code-First approach using these commands:
- `dotnet ef migrations add initial -c StoreContext --startup-project ../StoreUI/StoreUI.csproj`
- `dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../StoreUI/StoreUI.csproj `
- You will also need to populate your database with seed data of your choice

## Usage

After installation is complete and database migrated:

> Open index.html inside the Main folder in the Web portion of the code repo. This is the main page for the front end of the CF Books Store App.
> From here, you will be able to create a user account or sign in to one.
